1) Install python packages as listed in requirements.txt 
2) Run python file 
3) Access dashboard via http://localhost:8050/

Disclaimers: 

As some of the column names in the data dump excel file ('Lounge_Occupancy_Count.csv') have unintended spaces within the parentheses, some columns are unable 
to be recognised when accessing the data via a dataframe, hence resulting in a key error in the data dashboard. 

Example: 
Excel File: Occupancy Rate (1st - Workspace )
Notice there is a space right after Workspace.

Excel File: Occupancy Rate (Biz - Zen Area)
Notice there is no space right after Area.

Thank you.
